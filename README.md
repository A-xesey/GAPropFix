There are problem with creations that downloaded from the spore.com, when tags has space symbol and this disrupt check operations to specific tags (like gaprop or set:).

And to fix it was made this mod! This mod remove space symbols between tags when creation saved, imported or downloaded from spore.com.
For that was added cheat "updateDatabase" that force game to update databse (basically Pollination file were all creations files). This need it to update existing creations with bug tags.
Also was added gaprop tag check to the new game creation randomizer to avoid the creations that... don't look good to the game i guess.
